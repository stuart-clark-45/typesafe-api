# typesafe-api

#### Motivation

Let's face it everybody loves TypeScript and everybody needs APIs. 

We have typesafe frontends and typesafe backends, why not typesafe APIs?

This library will enable you to define your API spec in pure TS, easily create an API client to 
consume it, and implement routes and handlers on the server side.

This makes for speedy integration and oh so easy maintenance, you'll never miss a parameter in a request again!

#### Recommended Repo Architecture

The following dependency diagram show the suggested repo architecture you should use to 
define your API. 

![alt text](docs/images/repo-archetecture.png "Repo architecture diagram")

The recommended architecture is to define your API spec in a separate repo. Create an npm module for 
it then use it as dependency in both your backend project and any consuming services / frontends for the API.

* N.B. use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link) to experiment with changes to 
your API spec before your publish to npm it will save you tones of time!

You could conceivably define the API spec from within the the backend and export the relevant 
objects and interfaces however this would probably make life more difficult as you would end up with 
multiple builds in the same repo (so as to avoid importing the whole project backend when you want 
to consume the api) etc.

## Getting started

Here is a minimal example to get you started...

### API Spec 

We are going to define an basic API with just one endpoint.

When defining an API endpoint there are two main concepts we need to think about.

1)  `EndpointDef`
    
    You need to create an custom `EndpointDef` for each endpoint in your API. This type represents
    the interface for the API endpoint e.g.
     * URL params
     * Query params, 
     * The request body 
     * Any headers that must be set
     * The expected response type
     * What error codes can be expected to be returned by the endpoint
 
2) `Route`
    
    This is an object that represents the API path and method that should be used when calling the 
    endpoint

Let's define an endpoint...
 
```ts
// ../typesafe-api-example/api-spec/src/routes/hello-world.ts

import {EndpointDef, ErrorHandlers, ErrorType, ReqOptions, Route} from 'typesafe-api';

// Define the route at which the endpoint belongs
export const helloWoldRoute: Route = {
  method: 'get',
  path: '/hello-world'
};

// Define the all parameters that are required to make the request
export interface HelloWorldReq extends ReqOptions {
  query: {
    yourName: string;
  }
}

// Define the response type we wil receive for the request
export interface HelloWorldResp {
  msg: string,
  date: Date,
}

// Define any error that may be thrown by the endpoint, the default is just `500`
export type HelloWorldErrors = ErrorType<500|400>

// Create the endpoint definition this type encapsulates the full endpoint spec
export type HelloWorldEndpointDef = EndpointDef<HelloWorldReq, HelloWorldResp, HelloWorldErrors>




```

Now we have our route and endpoint defined we can very easily create an `ApiClient` for it.

```ts
// ../typesafe-api-example/api-spec/src/api-client.ts

import {AbstractApiClient, createRouteRequest} from 'typesafe-api';
import {helloWoldRoute, HelloWorldEndpointDef} from './routes';

// Create a client for our endpoint
class HelloApiClient extends AbstractApiClient {

  // Use createRouteRequest(..) to create a method to execute your request
  private _helloWorld = createRouteRequest<HelloWorldEndpointDef>(this, helloWoldRoute);

  // Abstract away the details of the request, devs writing calling code shouldn't need
  // to think about it
  public helloWorld = (yourName: string) => this._helloWorld({query: {yourName}});
}

// Depending how many endpoints you have you may want to start nesting your API clients like this
export class RootApiClient extends AbstractApiClient {
  public helloApi = (): HelloApiClient => new HelloApiClient(null, this);
}

```

Great that's our API spec all sorted. Now all that remains make sure __everything is exported__ in 
your entry point for your module e.g.

```ts
// ../typesafe-api-example/api-spec/src/index.ts
```
 
Now publish your spec as an npm module. In this example the package published is called `typesafe-api-demo-api-spec` 

### Backend

Currently this is only full implemented for `express` however if you dont use this (or something compatible)
you should still get a lot out of importing the `EndpointDef`s and `Routes` into your project. 

Contributions very welcome if you find a way to fully integrate with any other server frameworks :) 

#### Controller

So assuming you are using `express` we want to start out by creating a `Controller` to handle our requests...

```ts
// ../typesafe-api-example/backend/src/hello-world.ts

import {Controller, sendError, TRequest, TResponse} from 'typesafe-api';
import {HelloWorldEndpointDef} from 'typesafe-api-demo-api-spec';


export const helloWorldController: Controller<HelloWorldEndpointDef> = (
  req: TRequest<HelloWorldEndpointDef>,
  res: TResponse<HelloWorldEndpointDef>
) => {

  // `req.query` is typesafe so you know which keys have been set in the request
  const name = req.query.yourName;

  // As an example, let's return an error the name parameter is a number
  const isNumber = (s: string) => /^\d+$/.test(s);
  if (isNumber(name)) {

    // This error object is typesafe, including the status so you can only select from the
    // statuses given in the endpoint definition
    return sendError(res, {
      status: 400,
      msg: "Surely your name isn't a number?? ðŸ˜µ"
    });

  }

  // No surprises, this body is typesafe too!
  res.send({
    msg: `Hello ${name}!`,
    date: new Date()
  })

};

``` 

These `Controller`s are completely compatible with `express` so using the routing in the next stage is 
optional (tho advised as it guaranties your routes are correct)

#### Routes

Now we have a controller we just need to set up a route to it.

Here is a very simple express app using our newly created `Controller`

```ts
// ../typesafe-api-example/backend/src/index.ts

import express, {RequestHandler} from 'express';
import {addRoute, ExpressRoute} from 'typesafe-api';
import {helloWorldController} from './hello-world';
import {helloWoldRoute, HelloWorldEndpointDef} from 'typesafe-api-demo-api-spec';
import cors from 'cors';

const app = express();

// Define the middleware we want for the route
const middleware: RequestHandler[] = [cors(), express.json()];

// Import the route from the api-spec then add the additional fields needed for an {@link ExpressRoute}
const eHelloWorldRoute: ExpressRoute<HelloWorldEndpointDef> = {
  ...helloWoldRoute,
  middleware,
  controller: helloWorldController
};

// Add the route to the express app
addRoute(app, eHelloWorldRoute);

// Start the server
const port = 7809;
const server = app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

### Frontend

Great so now we have a working endpoint we want to use it. In this example we will use  a simple 
react app. However, the steps are very similar for any backend systems you want to consume your API.

One you have your API spec installed you can define a component similar to this

```tsx
// ../typesafe-api-example/frontend/src/App.tsx

import React, {useState} from 'react';
import './App.css';
import {ErrorHandlers, handleError} from 'typesafe-api';
import {HelloWorldEndpointDef, RootApiClient} from 'typesafe-api-demo-api-spec';

// The base url of your backend
const baseUrl = "http://localhost:7809";

// Get an instance of the api client we want to use from the api spec created
const helloApi = new RootApiClient(baseUrl).helloApi();

// Define a helper function to call the endpoint
const callHelloWorld = (name: string) => {
  return helloApi.helloWorld({
    query: {
      yourName: name,
    }
  });
};

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [responseText, setResponseText] = useState("");

  // Set up error handlers in case the API call fails
  // (the compiler will tell you if you are missing any)
  const callHelloWorldError: ErrorHandlers<HelloWorldEndpointDef> = {
    500: (err) => {throw err;},
    400: (err) => {
      const response = err.response;
      if (!response) {
        throw err;
      }
      setResponseText(response.data.msg)
    }
  };

  // Define onClick function that calls the endpoint and handles any errors
  const onClick = async () => {
    try {
      const {msg} = await callHelloWorld(name);
      setResponseText(msg);
    } catch (err) {
      handleError(err as any, callHelloWorldError);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <p>
          Enter your name
        </p>
        <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}/>
        <button onClick={() => onClick()} >Say hi!</button>
        <p>
          {responseText}
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

And that's it you now have a typesafe API. The full source code for this example can be found
 [here](https://github.com/stuart-clark-45/typesafe-api-example) if you want to try it for yourself.
 
### Feature Ideas
* Generate api docs from `Route`s and `EndpointDef`s
* Create reference docs for `typesafe-api`
